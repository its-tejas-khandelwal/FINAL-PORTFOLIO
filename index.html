            <p class="card-text">I am Tejas, a passionate and driven student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science Engineering (CSE). With a strong foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software development, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world challenges.</p>
            <p class="card-text">
              <h5>SKILLS</h5>
              As a third-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student, I possess strong skills in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python, with practical experience in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js). I have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, and actively engage in competitive programming. My experience includes working with databases (MySQL, MongoDB), version control (Git, GitHub), and developing RESTful APIs. I am familiar with machine learning tools like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, as well as cloud computing platforms (AWS, Google Cloud). Additionally, I have a good grasp of software development practices, including OOP, unit testing, and networking fundamentals. I am a strong communicator, a collaborative team player, and continuously strive to stay updated with emerging technologies.<br><br>

      <center> <h5>PROJECTS</h5> </center>
      As part of the Aviothic 1.0 Hackathon held at Kanpur Institute of Technology, I created a prototype for the Aikyam NGO website. Aikyam is a social initiative dedicated to supporting both children and elderly individuals, providing a safe and nurturing environment for their well-being. The website serves as a platform for volunteers, donors, and the community to connect and contribute to the cause.

      I took the lead in designing and developing the website using Wix, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface with features like volunteer registration, donation options, and event management. The website’s responsive design ensures accessibility across devices, and its clean layout helps visitors easily navigate and engage with the NGO's mission.<br>
